    <h3>WE’RE AT OUR BEST WHEN WE’RE MAKING.</h3>

    <h4>Make, from anywhere.</h4>
    <p>There’s never been a better time for making: anywhere in the world, anyone with a laptop and an internet connection can learn to make an app. Building things has never been so globally democratized.</p>

    <h4>Hack, hack, hack.</h4>
    <p>The goal of Hack Club is to help you become a hacker. We want a space at every school where people are making interesting things with code, every week. Schools don’t provide that, so we’re creating it in every school to make building things accessible to everyone.</p>

    <h4>Start building.</h4>
    <p>Most coding classes teach you programming concepts instead of how to write real code—it’s like trying to learn carpentry without any wood. So at Hack Club, you learn to code entirely through building things. You start with no experience and build and ship a project every meeting.<p>
